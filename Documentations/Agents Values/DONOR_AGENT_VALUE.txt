HOW DONOR AGENT + INTELLIGENT SCORING IMPROVES HAEMOLOGIX
================================================================================

BEFORE (Manual Donor Selection)
================================================================================
1. Staff manually searches donor list by blood type
2. Staff calls donors in random order or by proximity only
3. No scientific ranking - just gut feeling
4. Staff doesn't know who will actually respond
5. Staff wastes time calling ineligible donors
6. 30-50 manual calls, 30-60 minutes total

PROBLEM: Manual selection is slow, arbitrary, and often contacts wrong donors.
Staff can't evaluate 5+ factors simultaneously for optimal matching.


AFTER (With Donor Agent + Intelligent Scoring)
================================================================================
1. Agent finds all eligible donors in seconds
2. Agent validates medical eligibility automatically:
   - Blood type compatibility
   - Last donation date (90+ days)
   - Age, weight, hemoglobin levels
   - All disease tests negative
3. Agent scores each donor using 5-factor algorithm (0-100 scale)
4. Agent ranks donors by composite score
5. Agent sends SMS to top 10-20 simultaneously
6. All happens in < 3 seconds, fully autonomous

RESULT: Scientifically optimal donor selection, 10x faster.


5-FACTOR INTELLIGENT SCORING ALGORITHM
================================================================================

Final Score = (Distance × 30%) + (History × 25%) + (Responsiveness × 25%) + 
              (Time × 10%) + (Health × 10%)

FACTOR 1: Distance (30% weight)
- Closer donors score higher
- Uses Haversine formula for accurate distance
- Example: 5km = 90 points, 15km = 70 points, 30km = 50 points

FACTOR 2: Donation History (25% weight)
- Optimal: 90-180 days since last donation = 100 points
- Good: 180-365 days = 80 points
- Acceptable: 1-2 years = 60 points
- Ensures donors are eligible and healthy

FACTOR 3: Responsiveness (25% weight)
- Past response rate: accepted/total alerts
- Response speed: faster = higher score
- New donors get neutral 50 points
- System learns who is most reliable

FACTOR 4: Time-of-Day (10% weight)
- Best: 9-11am, 2-5pm = 100 points
- Good: 11am-2pm, 5-8pm = 80 points
- Poor: 8pm-9am = 40 points
- Critical alerts override (all times = 100)

FACTOR 5: Health Status (10% weight)
- Hemoglobin: >14 = 100, 13-14 = 80, <13 = 60
- BMI: 18.5-24.9 = 100, 25-29.9 = 80
- No medications = 100, minor meds = 80
- Ensures safe donations


KEY IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

1. ACCURACY
   Manual: Random selection or proximity only
   Agentic: 5-factor scientific scoring
   Impact: Always contacts best matches first

2. FAIRNESS
   Manual: Bias toward familiar donors
   Agentic: Objective algorithm, no bias
   Impact: Equal opportunity for all eligible donors

3. SPEED
   Manual: 30-60 minutes to evaluate and call
   Agentic: 3 seconds to find, score, rank, notify
   Impact: 10-20x faster donor matching

4. LEARNING
   Manual: No improvement over time
   Agentic: Learns response patterns, gets smarter
   Impact: Continuously improving accuracy

5. SCALE
   Manual: Staff evaluates 10-20 donors max
   Agentic: Evaluates 100+ donors simultaneously
   Impact: Finds optimal matches others miss

6. RELIABILITY
   Manual: Inconsistent quality based on staff
   Agentic: Same high-quality matching 24/7
   Impact: Predictable, dependable outcomes


REAL-WORLD SCENARIO
================================================================================

50 Donors Available, Need to Contact 10

MANUAL PROCESS (30-45 min):
- Staff filters by blood type manually
- Staff sorts by proximity only
- Staff calls closest 10 donors
- 6 don't answer, 2 are ineligible (recent donation), 2 accept
- May not be optimal matches
- Total time: 45 minutes

AGENTIC PROCESS (3-5 seconds):
- Agent finds all 50 donors
- Agent validates eligibility: 35 pass medical checks
- Agent scores all 35 using 5 factors
- Top scores:
  * Donor A: 92.5 (5km, donated 120 days ago, 90% response rate)
  * Donor B: 88.3 (8km, donated 100 days ago, 85% response rate)
  * Donor C: 85.0 (12km, perfect health, new donor)
- Agent sends SMS to top 10 simultaneously
- All 10 are verified eligible and optimal matches
- Total time: 3 seconds


EXAMPLE SCORING OUTPUT
================================================================================

Donor: John Doe
- Blood Type: O- (compatible with O+, A+, B+, AB+, O-, A-, B-, AB-)
- Distance: 5.2km from hospital
- Last Donation: 120 days ago (optimal range)
- Response History: 9/10 alerts accepted (90%)
- Time: 10:00 AM (optimal)
- Hemoglobin: 14.5 g/dL (excellent)

SCORES:
- Distance: 85.0 (very close)
- History: 100.0 (optimal donation interval)
- Responsiveness: 90.0 (highly reliable)
- Time-of-Day: 100.0 (best time)
- Health: 95.0 (excellent condition)

FINAL SCORE: 92.5/100 → RANK #1

Agent Decision: "Select John Doe as top candidate based on composite scoring. 
Closest available donor (5.2km) with optimal donation history and 90% response 
rate. Highest probability of acceptance and successful donation."


BLOOD TYPE COMPATIBILITY (Built-In)
================================================================================

Agent automatically handles compatibility:
- O- → Can donate to ALL (universal donor)
- O+ → Can donate to O+, A+, B+, AB+
- A- → Can donate to A-, A+, AB-, AB+
- A+ → Can donate to A+, AB+
- B- → Can donate to B-, B+, AB-, AB+
- B+ → Can donate to B+, AB+
- AB- → Can donate to AB-, AB+
- AB+ → Can donate to AB+ only

Manual systems often make compatibility errors. Agent never does.


MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY VALIDATION (Automatic)
================================================================================

Agent checks 8 criteria before scoring:
1. Blood type compatible
2. Status = APPROVED
3. Age 18-65
4. Weight >= 50kg
5. Last donation >= 90 days (male) or >= 120 days (female)
6. Hemoglobin >= 13.0 (male) or >= 12.5 (female)
7. HIV, Hepatitis B/C, Syphilis, Malaria = NEGATIVE
8. Within search radius

Manual checking prone to errors. Agent validates 100% accurately.

WHAT DONOR AGENT DOES AUTONOMOUSLY
================================================================================

1. Receives shortage event from Hospital Agent
2. Queries all donors matching blood type
3. Validates medical eligibility (8 criteria)
4. Calculates distance using Haversine formula
5. Scores each donor on 5 factors (weighted algorithm)
6. Ranks all eligible donors by composite score
7. Selects top N donors (10-20, or 2× units needed)
8. Sends SMS notifications simultaneously
9. Logs decision with reasoning
10. Tracks notifications for learning

ALL WITHOUT HUMAN INTERVENTION.


BUSINESS VALUE
