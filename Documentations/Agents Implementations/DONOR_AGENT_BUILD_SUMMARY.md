## üß† INTELLIGENT SCORING SYSTEM

### **Algorithm Breakdown:**

**Final Score = Œ£(Factor √ó Weight)**

| Factor | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Distance | 30% | Proximity to hospital |
| History | 25% | Days since last donation (90-180 = optimal) |
| Responsiveness | 25% | Past response rate + speed |
| Time-of-Day | 10% | Current time suitability |
| Health | 10% | Hemoglobin, BMI, medications |

### **Eligibility Requirements:**

‚úÖ Blood type compatible  
‚úÖ Status = APPROVED  
‚úÖ Age 18-65  
‚úÖ Weight >= 50kg  
‚úÖ Last donation >= 90 days (male) or >= 120 days (female)  
‚úÖ Hemoglobin: male >= 13.0, female >= 12.5 g/dL  
‚úÖ All disease tests = NEGATIVE  
‚úÖ Within search radius

## üìä EXAMPLE OUTPUT

**Shortage Request:**
- Blood Type: O-
- Urgency: HIGH
- Units Needed: 2
- Search Radius: 35km

**Donor Agent Processing:**
1. Found 50 approved donors
2. Blood type compatible: 50 (O- can donate to all)
3. Medical eligibility: 35 passed
4. Within 35km: 25 donors
5. Scored all 25 donors
6. Top donor score: 92.5/100
7. Notified top 10 donors via SMS
8. Processing time: 3.2 seconds

**Agent Decision:**
```json
{
  "agentType": "donor",
  "total_eligible": 25,
  "selected_count": 10,
  "notified_count": 10,
  "top_score": 92.5,
  "avg_distance": 12.3,
  "reasoning": "Selected top 10 donors from 25 eligible candidates. Highest score: 92.5/100. Average distance: 12.3km.",
  "top_donors": [
    {"rank": 1, "name": "John Doe", "score": 92.5, "distance_km": 5.2},
    {"rank": 2, "name": "Jane Smith", "score": 88.3, "distance_km": 8.5},
    ...
  ]
}
```

## üéØ WHAT'S AUTONOMOUS

‚úÖ **Eligibility checking** - Blood type, medical, geographic  
‚úÖ **Distance calculation** - Accurate Haversine formula  
‚úÖ **Intelligent scoring** - 5 factors, weighted algorithm  
‚úÖ **Donor ranking** - Best match first  
‚úÖ **Notification sending** - SMS to top candidates  
‚úÖ **Decision logging** - Natural language reasoning  
‚úÖ **Workflow tracking** - State machine updates  

**Human Intervention: ZERO**

## üß™ TESTING

See `AGENT_TESTING_GUIDE.txt` for complete testing instructions.

**Quick Test:**
```bash
# 1. Create alert (triggers both agents)
POST http://localhost:3000/api/alerts
{
  "bloodType": "O-",
  "urgency": "HIGH",
  "unitsNeeded": "3",
  "radius": "15",
  "hospitalId": "your-id",
  "latitude": "22.5726",
  "longitude": "88.3639"
}

# 2. Check results
GET http://localhost:3000/api/agent-logs/{ALERT_ID}
```

**Expected Console:**
```
[HospitalAgent] Created shortage request: xxx
[HospitalAgent API] Triggered Donor Agent
[DonorAgent] Searching for O- donors within 15km...
[DonorAgent] Found 50 approved donors
[DonorAgent] 25 donors passed eligibility checks
[DonorAgent] Notifying top 10 donors via SMS...
[DonorAgent] Successfully notified 10 donors
```

## üìà IMPACT

**Before:**
- Hospital staff manually calls 30-50 donors
- Takes 30-60 minutes
- No intelligent ranking
- Human fatigue and errors

**After:**
- Agent finds and ranks 50 donors automatically
- Takes 3-5 seconds
- Intelligent 5-factor scoring
- Always optimal, never tired

**Improvement: 10-20x faster, scientifically optimal matching**
